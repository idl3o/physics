# Archive - Original Implementation

This directory preserves the original implementation before the truth→simplicity synthesis.

## Contents

### original_src/
- `dimensional_transitions/` - Original 0↔N framework with consciousness focus
- `infinite_dimensional/` - Original infinite-dimensional physics implementation

### original_docs/
- Multiple whitepapers exploring different aspects
- Original complex web interface
- Redundant documentation files

## Why Archived?

The original implementation contained valuable insights but suffered from:
1. **Parallel frameworks** that didn't communicate
2. **Overlapping documentation** requiring multiple reads
3. **Mathematical oversimplification** without acknowledgment
4. **Complex presentation** obscuring simple truths

## What Was Preserved?

The core insights were preserved and refined in the new synthesis:
- Unity↔Multiplicity cycle concept
- Dimensional hierarchy structure  
- Emergence through dimensional transitions
- Consciousness as dimensional phenomenon

## Accessing Archive

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding evolution of ideas
- Extracting specific implementations
- Academic completeness

For current work, use the unified framework in `src/physics_emergence/`.
