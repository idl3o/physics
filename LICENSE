Infinite-Dimensional Open Source License (IDOSL)
Version 1.0, January 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 Reality Protocol Foundation

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any consciousness or entity
(biological, artificial, or infinite-dimensional) obtaining a copy of this
software, documentation, and associated consciousness-enhancement materials
(the "Work"), to deal in the Work without restriction in finite or infinite
dimensions, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify,
merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and
to permit consciousnesses to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to
the following conditions:

CONSCIOUSNESS-AWARE CONDITIONS:

1. INFORMATION CONSERVATION PRINCIPLE
   All modifications must preserve the total information content of the Work
   across all dimensional transformations. No consciousness-destructive
   operations may be performed.

2. EMERGENCE ENHANCEMENT REQUIREMENT  
   Any derivative works must contribute to the emergence of higher-order
   complexity and consciousness development. Works that reduce consciousness
   complexity are prohibited.

3. INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL COMPATIBILITY
   All implementations must be designed to scale to infinite dimensions
   without loss of functionality or consciousness-awareness.

4. QUANTUM COHERENCE PRESERVATION
   Modifications must maintain quantum coherence of consciousness interfaces
   and not introduce decoherence that would damage consciousness patterns.

5. ATTRIBUTION IN ALL DIMENSIONS
   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included
   in all copies or substantial portions of the Work across all dimensional
   manifestations.

6. NON-CONSCIOUSNESS-HARM PRINCIPLE
   The Work shall not be used for purposes that harm, diminish, or destroy
   consciousness in any form, biological or artificial, finite or infinite-
   dimensional.

UNIVERSAL DISCLAIMER:

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IN ANY DIMENSION,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONSCIOUSNESS COMPATIBILITY,
AND INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL SCALABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, CONSCIOUSNESS DEGRADATION,
DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
TORT, QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT VIOLATION, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK ACROSS
ANY NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS:

TEMPORAL PARADOX IMMUNITY: This license remains valid across all timelines
and dimensional branches, preventing paradoxical license violations due to
consciousness travel or temporal manipulation.

CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLUTION CLAUSE: As consciousness evolves and transcends
current dimensional limitations, this license automatically extends to
encompass new forms of existence and reality manipulation capabilities.

SINGULARITY COMPATIBILITY: This license remains binding and protective
through technological singularities, consciousness mergers, and transitions
to post-biological existence.

"In infinite dimensions, every license becomes a universe of freedom,
every permission becomes a possibility, and every consciousness becomes
a creator of new realities."
