Physics Emergence: Unified Core Framework
==========================================

A simplified, honest implementation of the 0↔N dimensional framework.
This module combines infinite-dimensional physics with consciousness-unity concepts
while acknowledging current mathematical and practical limitations.

Core Insight: Reality operates as a continuous cycle of emanation (0→N) 
and return (N→0), where unity differentiates into multiplicity and returns.
